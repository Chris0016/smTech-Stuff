Teaching Notes

Goal: To introduce the concept of variables. To explain the string and integer data types.

Remarks:

1. Consider explaining the concept of variables through an analogy to a container that holds something. i.e. a cookie jar.

2. To avoid overloading the student, it is suggested to start out with only introducing the string and integer data types, and leaving other data types until later.
