Teaching Notes

Goal: Learn about output and write a multiline program.

Remarks:

1. Have the student write 3-5 print statements answering simple questions about themselves. (Go with 5 print statements unless the student is a slower typer).

2. Be creative with your questions, this is a great opportunity for you the teacher to learn about your student.

3. Emphasize that the order the print statements are written matches the order they are displayed in the console. Mention that programs are run line by line in the order that we write. Consider swapping around different print statements to demonstrate how their order in the console swaps as well.
