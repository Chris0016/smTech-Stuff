Teaching Notes
  
Goal: To set up the students repository and environment. To have the student write and run their very first program.   

Remarks: 
  
1. Up to this point, the student has presumably spent some amount of time setting up their repository and project. It is not a bad idea to reset, mention that all the setup is now done, and that you are now ready to begin learning code.

2. It may seem silly, but congratulate the student on writing and running their first program. Not only does the praise encourage the camper, but it can help erase any preconceived notions the student may have that programming has to be hard or difficult.

3. Mention that "Hello World" is a program that every programmer starts with when learning how to program or learning a new language.
  
"""

print("Hello World.")
